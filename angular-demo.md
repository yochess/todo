#Angular Demo

Here is the angular version of my todo social app. 
The html/css portion is really raw, but the logics and api are functioning.

##User 1 (drake)
  - creates a new account
  - edits profile (in this case, just username, password, or email)
  - add some todos (2 private, 2 protected, 2 public)

##User 2 (user)
  - add, edit, and delete a few todos
  - views drake's profile and sees public todos
  - makes drake a friend request
  - drake logs in and accepts friend request (only portions of the page refrshes)
  - both users can now see public and protected todos

##User 3 (third)
  - makes an account and can only see public information
